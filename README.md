# Jumping-The-Reality-Gap
Implementing Optimal Jumping On A Quadrupedal Robot

This gihub gives you access to the code used for my final year project and gifs showing the simulations achieved.
To view the gifs, you can open the GIFs directory.
To view the code used, you can open the Desktop directory.
The Desktop directory contains the Pybullet code, one for each of the robots.
Each of the Pybullet folders contain code, URDFs and Mesh files for the respectives robots.
The Desktop directory also contains the Pyomo code. Within the Pyomo folder, you will find Jupyter Notebook's for each of the robots.
